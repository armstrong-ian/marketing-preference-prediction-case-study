## One-minute summary
- **Question:** How well do people predict others’ choices, and do they project their own tastes?
- **Design:** N=32 Google Form with own-choice + predicted group-share per domain. Bias = predicted − actual; false-consensus = supporters’ mean prediction − non-supporters’.
- **Findings:** Under-estimation of majorities (Pretzels **53.1%**, Coke **56.3%**) by ~**−2.6 pp**, and over-estimation of Pop (**40.6%** actual vs **50.0%** predicted, **+9.4 pp**). False-consensus deltas ≈ **+8–12 pp**.
- **Implications:** Adjust gut estimates (≈±10 pp), randomize question order, and favor measured panels.
- **Limits:** Small local sample; binary categories; no confidence calibration.
